# Tower defense game

This is my first major project: the Tower Defense Game.

I used Unity as the game engine, in which I wrote scripts in C#. Game models were created in Blender, and textures in Gimp. I created this project together with a game development course from the Youtube channel "Brackeys". The game hasn't yet finished, but basic mechanics such as moving enemies, earning gold and placing turrets are already implemented.
